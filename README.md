## 📘 Overview  
**Smart Chat Bot** is an intelligent conversational assistant designed to provide **personalized information about Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** using data derived from the **Mayo Clinic** website.  
The chatbot leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to understand user queries and deliver accurate, medically verified responses in a user-friendly manner.

## ⚙️ Features  
- 🗣️ **Smart Conversations** — Understands user intent using NLP.  
- 🧬 **Personalized CKD Guidance** — Provides condition-specific insights.  
- 🧠 **Machine Learning-Driven** — Learns from data to improve responses.  
- 🌐 **Mayo Clinic Integration** — Supplies reliable, evidence-based content.  
- 💡 **User-Friendly Interface** — Simple and intuitive interaction flow.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Text Preprocessing:** Cleans and tokenizes user input using NLTK.
2. **Intent Classification:** Predicts query intent with a trained ML model (e.g., SVM or Neural Network).
3. **Response Generation:** Selects the best matching CKD-related response from the dataset.
4. **Feedback Loop:** Can be enhanced with reinforcement learning for adaptive response improvement.

## 🧭 Future Enhancements

* 🌍 **Deploy as a Flask web app** for public interaction.
* 🤖 **Integrate transformer-based NLP models** (e.g., BERT).
* 💬 **Add speech-to-text and text-to-speech** features for accessibility.
* 📈 **Expand knowledge base** to cover additional medical conditions.
