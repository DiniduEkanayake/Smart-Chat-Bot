# Smart Chatbot for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Information

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a **smart chatbot** using a **React frontend** and **Django backend** to provide accurate and personalized information about Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). The chatbot is designed to assist users by answering queries, offering guidance, and delivering reliable resources related to CKD. It leverages **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to ensure a seamless and intelligent user experience.

## Key Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understands and processes user queries in natural language.
- **Personalized Responses:** Provides tailored information based on user input.
- **React Frontend:** A modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface for seamless interaction.
- **Django Backend:** Robust backend for handling data processing, machine learning, and API integrations.
- **Machine Learning:** Improves response accuracy over time by learning from user interactions.
- **Integration with Mayo Clinic Website:** Directs users to relevant sections of the Mayo Clinic CKD page for additional information.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js for building an interactive and dynamic user interface.
- **Backend:** Django for server-side logic, database management, and API handling.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** NLTK/Spacy for text analysis and understanding user queries.
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn/TensorFlow for predictive modeling and improving chatbot responses.
- **APIs:** Integration with Mayo Clinic's website for real-time data retrieval.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or SQLite for storing user interactions and chatbot data.

## How It Works
1. **User Interaction:** Users interact with the chatbot through the React frontend by typing queries related to CKD symptoms, causes, treatments, or prevention.
2. **Query Processing:** The Django backend uses NLP to analyze the query and extract key information.
3. **Response Generation:** Based on the processed query, the chatbot provides accurate and relevant responses, including links to the Mayo Clinic CKD page.
4. **Continuous Learning:** The chatbot improves its responses over time using machine learning algorithms.
