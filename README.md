# Smart Chatbot for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Information

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a **smart chatbot** using **Python** and **Machine Learning** to provide accurate and personalized information about **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)**. The chatbot is designed to assist users visiting the [Mayo Clinic website](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521) by answering queries, offering guidance, and delivering reliable resources related to CKD.

## Key Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understands and processes user queries in natural language.
- **Personalized Responses:** Provides tailored information based on user input.
- **Integration with Mayo Clinic Website:** Directs users to relevant sections of the [Mayo Clinic CKD page](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521).
- **Machine Learning:** Improves response accuracy over time by learning from user interactions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language for chatbot development.
- **NLTK/Spacy:** For natural language processing and text analysis.
- **Scikit-learn/TensorFlow:** For machine learning and predictive modeling.
- **Flask/Django:** For backend integration and deployment.
- **APIs:** Integration with Mayo Clinic's website for real-time data retrieval.

## How It Works
1. **User Interaction:** Users interact with the chatbot by typing queries related to CKD symptoms, causes, treatments, or prevention.
2. **Query Processing:** The chatbot uses NLP to analyze the query and extract key information.
3. **Response Generation:** Based on the processed query, the chatbot provides accurate and relevant responses, including links to the [Mayo Clinic CKD page](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521).
4. **Continuous Learning:** The chatbot improves its responses over time using machine learning algorithms.
